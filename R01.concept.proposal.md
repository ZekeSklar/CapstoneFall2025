# CSC 493: R01: Project Concept Proposal<sup>1</sup>

As you know, the **Project Concept Proposal** is typically used to make a case for a project and it is frequently the first document to be created in the software development life cycle. You have begun your <code>README.md</code> for the initial part of your project concept proposal by drafting the following sections:

<code>README.md</code>
- Berea College Printer Inventory and ordering system
- **Project Concept (linked to <code>concept.md</code>)**
- Prerequisites
- Python, Djanjo library
- Zechariah Sklar
- Acknowledgments

## Concept Proposal
We want you to take some of the feedback you received from the brainstorming session to flesh out your project and give a more formal proposal. We understand that at this point, some of what you write will be guesses, so this is a <strong>living document</strong> that may change over time. Create a file called <code>concept.md</code> in your repository and include details in the following sections:

<code>concept.md</code>
  - Project Name
  - Goals
  - Context
  - Novelty
  - Functionality
  - Audience
  - Challenges
  - Measures
  - Motivation
  - Future Extensions
  - *Other (Optional)*

**Goals:** To provide a better system to college staff for ordering and reporting for the campus printers and allowing print staff to manage inventory more efficently. 

**Context:** A statement context for the proposed project including a statement of the need or opportunity which your project is intended to address. Including very brief descriptions of existing similar products and their utility and limitations and/or advantages and disadvantages. (Use hyperlinks

**Novelty:** The novelty of your solution and/or the enhancements you propose

**Functionality:** The expected project functionality and characteristics

**Audience:** The intended audience will be printing staff and faculty and students on berea college campus. 

**Challenges:** Making sure all devices have a matching QR code 

**Measures:** An outline of project measures of success (how you will know when you have met the requirements.)

**Motivation:** Great experince for building systems and will help with my current job when done. 

**Future Extensions:** make it look better and add some automation to it. 

**Other:** (Optional section) To the above, you may add any additional items that you think will strengthen your proposal.

You may want to use [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) and [MarkDown Live Demo](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

Add a relative link to concept.md from README.md to concept.md. (A relative link uses just the file name and not http://...) Test this link and make sure it works.

# To Submit

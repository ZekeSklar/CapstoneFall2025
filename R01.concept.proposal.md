# Project Concept — Berea College Printing Services

## Project Name
Printing Services Admin Portal (Inventory, Tickets, Live Device Status)

## Goals
- Centralize printer inventory and request/issue workflows.
- Surface live device health via SNMP to reduce downtime.
- Provide daily summaries and dashboards for quick triage.

## Context
Campus operations depend on reliable printing. Existing tools (e.g., MFP web consoles, PaperCut) provide some telemetry but not unified inventory/ticketing. This portal brings inventory, tickets, and device status into one admin workflow with low operational overhead and no agent on devices (SNMP only).

## Novelty
- Live SNMP status directly in Django Admin and manager dashboard with 5‑minute cadence + manual refresh.
- Rate‑limited issue intake that preserves user experience while protecting the backend.
- Daily digest that summarizes open issues to targeted recipients and opt‑in admins.

## Functionality
- Inventory: manage printers, groups, comments, QR tokens.
- Tickets: supply and issue tickets with email notifications; group scope.
- Live status: per‑printer SNMP status, error flags, alerts, supplies (when device exposes Printer‑MIB tables).
- Admin index alerts: attention/SNMP faults roll‑up.
- Daily email: once/interval digest to env recipient and subscribed superusers.

## Audience
- Printing Services staff and managers (admin/manager views)
- Campus users scanning device QR codes (public portal for requests/issues)

## Challenges
- Diverse device support; not all expose full Printer‑MIB tables.
- SNMP network reachability and community management.
- Avoiding noisy duplicate issue reports during incidents.

## Measures of Success
- Time to detect and triage device faults decreases.
- Fewer duplicate issue tickets (enforced via rate limiting).
- Staff can view latest device status in a single place with <5 minutes staleness.

## Motivation
Provide practical operational value to Printing Services while demonstrating full‑stack development, device telemetry integration, and admin UX.

## Future Extensions
- Vendor‑specific OIDs (e.g., Toshiba enterprise branch) for richer supplies/alerts.
- Historical trending and charts; export to BI.
- Role‑based notifications and on‑call rotations.

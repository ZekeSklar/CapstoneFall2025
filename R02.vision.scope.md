# Vision and Scope — Berea College Printing Services

## Vision
Offer Printing Services a unified portal to manage printer inventory and tickets and to observe live device health (via SNMP) so that outages are shorter and supplies are replenished proactively.

## Scope
- Included
  - Printer inventory, groups, and comments
  - Request/issue tickets with email notifications (group or single-printer scope)
  - Live per‑printer SNMP status (latest only) with manual refresh and 5‑minute cadence
  - Admin index: “Printer Device Alerts” roll‑up (attention/SNMP fault summary)
  - Daily issue summary email with recipient from env and superuser opt‑in
  - Issue report rate limiting: max 3 per printer per hour; user still receives “thank you”
  - Public QR portal for requests/issues; manager dashboard for admins
- Excluded (for now)
  - Device provisioning/firmware, historical telemetry/trending, SSO/multi‑tenant auth
  - Third‑party BI integration; complex workflow/SLAs; vendor‑specific OIDs beyond minimal

## Notes
- SNMP support targets standard Printer‑MIB tables. Some models expose limited data; vendor OIDs can be added later.
- JSON endpoints and client scripts use cache‑busting and send `Cache-Control: no-store`.

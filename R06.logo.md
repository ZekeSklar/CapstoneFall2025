## Logo and Branding

The admin portal is currently branded with a textual header:

- Site header: “Berea College Printing Services” (Django Admin custom titles)

Next steps for a logo:
- Produce a simple wordmark (Berea College Printing Services) with an icon (e.g., printer glyph) suitable for dark/light backgrounds.
- Add logo file under `codebase/tickets/static/tickets/` and load it in a small admin CSS.

Until then, the text header remains the default branding.
